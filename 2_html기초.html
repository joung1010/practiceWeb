        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS, is a 
            programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[9] 
            JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
             It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation
             , and first-class functions.<br>

            Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the
             World Wide Web.[10] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an
              essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it
               for client-side page behavior,[11] and all major web browsers have a dedicated
               avaScript engine to execute it.</p>
